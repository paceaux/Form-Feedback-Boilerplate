HTML Notes:   This form feedback boiler plate assumes that the label appears after the input field. This allows us to use the ~ sibling selector with the fields' dynamic pseudo classes to bold a label when the user is typing.

Usage:        This uses object-oriented CSS. Shape and position elements as you see fit. I've broken everything up into four distinct layers, and provided comments which capture each layer. To style the label for Radio buttons, I used an attribute selector for the "for" value of the label. Whatever you name your radio buttons (and their subsequent label), you need to change this line in the CSS. Layer four is when the user is in the last form field before the submit button. The non CSS3 selection means you know what the last form-field isâ€¦ in this case it's textarea. You'll need to adjust that. The CSS3 method won't require that at all.
